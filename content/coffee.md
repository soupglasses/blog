I used to know someone who opened the door to their world with two simple words: [Say hi!](https://sonnet.io/posts/hi). They would invite you to a voice call, like inviting you to a cup of coffee at the local cafe. Whether it was about your wildest idea, or simply to share how your week has been going. It wasn’t about formal meetings or consulting fees, it was about kindness and that human connection.

That inspired me to continue this tradition forward, which is what this page is. So, whether you want to talk about your newest project, critique a draft, or just share something cool that has been on your mind, I’m here. Say hi, and lets have a chat.
